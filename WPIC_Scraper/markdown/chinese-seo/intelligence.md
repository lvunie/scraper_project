### [Four Steps to Optimal Baidu SEO &amp; Content Marketing](http://www.chinadigitalreview.com/four-easy-steps-for-great-baidu-seo-and-content-marketing/ "Four Steps to Optimal Baidu SEO &amp; Content Marketing")

<span style="font-size: medium;">Baidu is China&apos;s Google with a twist - it owns the most popular knowledge properties, and ensures that they come up on top of virtually all organic search results.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, the best way to get to the front page for competitive Chinese terms is to place knowledge on Baidu properties such as [Baike](http://www.baike.com/), [Zhidao](http://zhidao.baidu.com/), and [Wenku](http://wenku.baidu.com/).</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">These platforms can be used to link the information back to a proprietary site, and save considerable time and investment in drawing targeted eyes, as opposed to solely on striving to get one&apos;s own site to the front page for keywords.</span>

### [Getting to First Page on Baidu](http://www.chinadigitalreview.com/baidu-seo-only-the-big-boys-win/ "Getting to First Page on Baidu")

<span style="font-size: medium;">Baidu&apos;s organic results for commercial keywords are significantly more commercialized than those on Google. Besides Baidu&apos;s knowledge properties, which appear top ten organically for virtually all searches, there are major portals for all industries that aggregate product information and facilitate purchase, also dominating the front page of such searches. Therefore, disseminating brand and product information across these major platforms is best practice for both branding and SEO. For example, a New Zealand winery would contribute to the knowledge about local vintages on Baidu Baike, upload a localized brochure to Baide Wenku, and post both relevant questions and answers on Baidu Zhidao. Cooperation with Baidu&apos;s ecommerce search engine Weigou and a related ecommerce platform such as YesMyWine can also drive top results with strategic account development and promotion. The key concept is to decentralize, de-emphasizing the heavy, proprietary website and contributing to the conversation at the most relevant and popular nodes of the Chinese Internet.</span>
