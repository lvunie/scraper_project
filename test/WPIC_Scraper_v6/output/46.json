However, none of these tools can be implemented to effect without first obtaining an Internet Content Provider number from China’s Ministry of Information., ,Depending on your organization’s legal status in China, the ICP process can be a relatively straightforward or complex affair. No matter your situation, WPIC will handle the bureaucratic procedures with minimal time required from your resources, and maximum efficiency, preparing you for digital marketing deployment in a workable timeframe."

Registration process reveals previous incomplete application for ICP initiated by associated organization. Conflicts resolved via paperwork. Further bureaucratic review results in requests for changes to site, which WPIC implements after advisement with appropriate Canadian government contact., ,Results:,ICP number obtained within one month, after government advertising campaign in China had been stalled for more than six months. SEM campaign launched immediately thereafter, returning impressive ROI."
