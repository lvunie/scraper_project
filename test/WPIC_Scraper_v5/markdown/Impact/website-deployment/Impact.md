## Impact 

A specialty foods seller found that the project plan for its China site had significant gaps between development and deployment, with resultant delays that were impacting tangential marketing and sales efforts.

Tactics:

1.  Resolve outstanding hosting issues by facilitating ICP, switching to cloud hosting
2.  Server security issues resolved through cloud hosting and comprehensive testing
3.  Load testing revealed configuration problems, quickly resolved
4.  Site backed up
5.  Plan for ongoing testing and monitoring implemented

Results:

Site was successfully launched only three weeks past project deadline, and two weeks after engaging WPIC. User experience and functionality superior enough to garner good reviews and drive sales.
