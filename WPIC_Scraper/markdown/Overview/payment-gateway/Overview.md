## Overview 

In the West, the most common point of lead loss is at the payment gateway, and not just from customers&#x2019; second thoughts. Counter-intuitive, low-trust-creating UI is just as responsible for lost sales. The same holds true online in China, doubly so for western sites, whose payment options and procedures all too often greatly limit the number of Chinese who can transact with them. The surging popularity of mobile payments in China adds another important consideration towards an ideal payment solution.

&#xA0;

Currently, Alipay has over 60% market share for online payments, but other players such as Tencent offer products with competitive benefits, while China&#x2019;s big banks are rapidly positioning to capture market share, especially in the mobile sector.
