### [Cross Border eCommerce for China?](http://www.chinadigitalreview.com/understanding-alibabas-new-ecommerce-opportunity-epass/ "Cross Border eCommerce for China?")

<span style="font-size: medium;">Despite our successes driving brand and significant revnue via in-China ecommerce solutions, from stand alone sites to Tmall stores, WPIC is always cognizant of the deep resources necessary for such an approach, often a deal-breaker for the SME. Leaner approaches are typically much less viable for healthy returns. Howeer, Alipay&apos;s new product ePass heralds a new approach, still embryonic, that will with time make cross-border ecommerce much more feasible for western companies who would like to tap the wprld&apos;s biggest online market without establishing in mainland China. Alipay, a soon to be spun off division of Alibaba, has more than 50% of China&apos;s online payment market. With ePass, a western online vendor can install Alipay on his western site, get remunerated for RMB purchases in western currency, let Alibaba&apos;s logistics network handle fulfillment, and advertise through a segment of Alibaba&apos;s massive advertising ecosystem. JD and Amazon are developing their own cross border products in response, as the market in China was over $30 billion in 2013, and growing fast. Web Presence In China is leading the way in developing solutions that overcome the tolerances of a cross-border China ecommerce approach, from load-time to return issues.&#xA0;</span>
