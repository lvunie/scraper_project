## Impact 

An Australian wine brand found that it was losing brand equity and sales to distributors who were in violation of agreements. The wine company wanted to license its China product line to a reputable distributor, with legal guarantees for brand and quality protection.

Tactics:

1.  Research of Chinese Internet for B2B wine distributors
2.  Vetted contact database with emails, then phone calls
3.  Facilitation of meetings with vetted, interested distributors
4.  Facilitation of legal process to draft licensing agreement, including translations of contracts

Results:

Satisfactory licensing agreement reached, including terms for new distributor to action steps in preventing counterfeiting of the Australian brand. Wine companyâ€™s China operations now reduced to shipping product to distributor, sending an average of ten containers per year.
