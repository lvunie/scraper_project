## Overview

The key to China analytics is remembering you&#x2019;re not in Google country anymore. Baidu, China&#x2019;s Google, is years way from anything resembling Google&#x2019;s landmark suite of tools. Third party site and search engine analytic tools touted as global solutions all fall short in China, as we&#x2019;ve learned from experience.

&#xA0;

The dearth of reliable, organized data and our focus on acquiring such has resulted in our service of designing and implementing data-driven analytical solutions customized to the China-specific needs of our clients.
