## Overview

A modicum of channel conflict can be perceived as a sign of healthy market coverage. In China, as in the West, absence of channel conflict can indicate gaps in coverage, especially with so many new digital channels available. The signs of destructive channel conflict are very clear: market share erosion, and declining margin as COGS rises in response.

WPIC utilizes economics and recommended controls to resolve channel conflict. Prior to that, we undertake a process of discovery that maps end user segmentation, pricing, organizational policies, support programs, and other elements of your overall channel strategy. This results in a set of economic recommendations that motivate channels to avoid conflict, and recommended structural controls that establish policies by which conflict is managed.
