In China, as in the West, absence of channel conflict can indicate gaps in coverage, especially with so many new digital channels available. The signs of destructive channel conflict are very clear: market share erosion, and declining margin as COGS rises in response., ,WPIC utilizes economics and recommended controls to resolve channel conflict. Prior to that, we undertake a process of discovery that maps end user segmentation, pricing, organizational policies, support programs, and other elements of your overall channel strategy. This results in a set of economic recommendations that motivate channels to avoid conflict, and recommended structural controls that establish policies by which conflict is managed., , ,Get in touch to discuss any channel noise you’re experiencing, and to qualify for a complimentary high-level mapping of your channel conflict in China."
