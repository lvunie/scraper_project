Android is the dominant Operating System, with Apple’s iOS still a viable force in the market. Meanwhile, Android-based Chinese OS are growing market share., ,The complexity of China’s app ecosystem is only a symptom of its vitality. WPIC can help you analyze that ecosystem for the most viable tech solution. Even better, we can build both native and mobile web apps, or scale your existing app for both scenarios and the Chinese user. Our bi-cultural tech team ensures that the app’s User Experience fulfills your vision, while matching the many quirks of China’s market, such as the limited functionality of its lower price-point smartphones."
