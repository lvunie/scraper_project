## Impact 

A boutique cosmetics online retailer had launched a Chinese site, maintaining its Paypal account as a payment gateway. This payment option is not well-known in China, and led to many lost sales.

Tactics:

1.  Facilitation of Alipay account registration
2.  Technical integration of Alipay into website using Java API

Results:

Conversion rate on Chinese website improved seven-fold, leading to an average of nine sales per day against less than two previously.
