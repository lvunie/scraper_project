## Overview 

One of the primary shortcomings of Chinese search engines, including Baidu, the dominant leader, is an analytic suite far less reliable and comprehensive than Google&#x2019;s. This shortcoming deprives analytics-focused organizations from the kinds of reliable data with which to make evidence-based decisions and strategy adjustments.

&#xA0;

WPIC picks up where Baidu and other Chinese engines leave off, early in the funnel of statistical site feedback, delivering the following segments:

*   Advertising and Campaign Performance
*   Analysis &amp; Testing
*   Audience Characteristics and Behavior
*   Cross Device/Cross Platform Measurement
*   Data Management (APIs, Filters, User Permissions)
*   Sales and Conversions
*   Site &amp; App Performance

&#xA0;

We also offer flexible methods for you to access and view this data, from regular comprehensive reporting to custom-built dashboards for real-time results. Our tech team is experienced in cooperating with client IT departments for integrated solutions in minimum turnaround time scenarios.
