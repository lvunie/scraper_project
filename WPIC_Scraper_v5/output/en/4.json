WPIC, however, has carved out a network of reliable partners, who can place advertising in targeted apps across China’s vast and fragmented mobile ecosystem. We can outsource everything from design of your ads and landing pages, to account management, to comprehensive reporting via manual report and/or shared dashboard., ,Get in touch to discuss how a mobile advertising campaign can drive market share among your China demographic, and qualify for a free ten hours of customized consultation."
