## Impact 

A Fortune 200 company had half a dozen operating companies with similar product lines and sales offices in China, but little transparency or accountability in the marketing/sales cycle.

Tactics:

1.  Kaizen workshop to map current marketing/sales cycle, identify delta
2.  Creation of bowlers for each operating company, with jumping off point metrics and realistic, mutually agreed targets
3.  Programming and implementation of customized CRM with dashboard interface including:

*   Real-time click and conversion tracking
*   Full conversion profiles, distribution maps
*   Enhanced Baidu analytics
*   Automatic account rep assignment and reporting
*   Automatic reporting features

Results:

Dashboard was key deliverable in Fortune 200 company’s initiative to “close the loop” between marketing and sales. Conversion to sales increased four-fold. Ad metrics and customer data provided insights allowing for accurate cost-per-customer, able to buy traffic with competitor-beating advantage.
