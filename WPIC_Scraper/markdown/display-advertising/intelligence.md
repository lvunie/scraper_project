<span style="font-size: medium;">A display ad campaign in China is usually a recipe for quick buget spend with suboptimal results and metrics. The more well-known platforms for relevant industries, and China&apos;s major portals, have ever-higher pricing with a lack of corresponding transparency and attribution. Programmatic display advertising is a growing but still embryonic industry, with rampant fraud, and most of the prime real estate reserved for China&apos;s biggest ad buyers. Mobile ads can also be a fast track to drained marketing reserves, given the ample room for tech errors and tracking.&#xA0;</span>
