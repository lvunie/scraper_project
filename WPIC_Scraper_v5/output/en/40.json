For western companies selling in China, however, logistics and fulfillment must be integrated into every phase of the process. From clearing customs and ERP integration, to aftersales support, your 3PL solution is critical at every stage of your China revenue model., ,While you can find many Chinese 3PL providers willing to partner with you, WPIC has narrowed down those with the proven ability to serve a western company reliably to a handful. We have worked with them in products from refrigerated produce to electronic goods. Together, we offer the peace of mind brought by outsourcing to an experienced provider with western best practice in the wheelhouse."
