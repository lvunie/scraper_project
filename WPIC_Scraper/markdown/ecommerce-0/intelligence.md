### [3 Must Dos for Your Chinese Ecommerce Website](http://www.chinadigitalreview.com/3-must-dos-for-your-chinese-ecommerce-website/ "3 Must Dos for Your Chinese Ecommerce Website")

<span style="font-size: medium;">Granted, an ecommerce site is the most efficient, scalable method of selling to China, the world&apos;s biggest market. Before undertaking to build a stand-alone ecommerce site, however, an organization _must_ do the following:</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">1. Definitively cross a Tmall store off as an option, and have sound justification for doing so.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">2. Commit to an open-source ecommerce system, such as Magento, unless able to justy the much higher costs and other inefficiencies of proprietary platforms such as Hybris and Demandware.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">3. Incorporate Tmall best practice into plans for the sites UX and other functionality. Tmall has defined the ecommerce paradigm Chinese online shoppers prefer and trust.</span>

### [Alibaba&apos;s Different Platforms](http://www.chinadigitalreview.com/alibaba-101-what-a-western-company-needs-to-know/ "Alibaba&apos;s Different Platforms")

Further to Alibaba&apos;s IPO, it behooves the western company to know the different aspects of the company&apos;s massive ecosystem. The B2B platform, 1688, is best for finding outsourcing options. Taobao is the C2C center, almost never a workable option for a western company. Tmall, the brand-verified, B2C platform, is proving an ever more viable option for western brands, with increasing UX options, huge numbers of high-converting organic traffic, and several of China&apos;s tech snafus (such as hosting) already covered. Alibaba also has a host of associated products, such as Alipay, to facilitate payments, wei-tao, a mobile shopping app, and Alimama, a massive advertising platform to help drive traffic to an established store.

### [ePass and cross border ecommerce for China](http://www.chinadigitalreview.com/understanding-alibabas-new-ecommerce-opportunity-epass/ "ePass and cross border ecommerce for China")

Alibaba recently launched a suite of services to make cross-border ecommerce easier for western companies looking to tap the Chinese market. The suite ties in Alipay, the most popular payment gateway in China, plus logistics services and access to the Alibaba advertising ecosystem. Localizing for potential Chinese visitors and ensuring fast load times still remains an issue. Meanwhile, Amazon and JD are working on cross-border offerings to compete with Alibaba. Cross-border can be a good approach for testing the market, obviating the costly and resource intensive procedures of China establishment and tech implementation. But while the cross-border market is growing rapidly, it helps to keep in mind that most of this growth is for brands well-recognized in China, but perhaps not available there yet, or else cheaper on a foreign site. Furthermore, the cross-border market is only a fraction of China&apos;s domestic online market. Some rigorous market intelligence should precede a commitment to cross-border as an ecommerce approach. Consult with WPIC, on-the-ground leaders in China ecommerce for western companies of all sizes.
