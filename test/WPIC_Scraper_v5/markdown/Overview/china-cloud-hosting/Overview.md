## Overview 

Without a doubt the most common problem western organizations face in lackluster traffic and conversion for their Chinese website is slow load times. Ironically, the more expensive the site, the slower it loads, with copious Flash and other multimedia applications dragging down the experience. It is critical to keep in mind that China&#x2019;s Internet infrastructure is among the world&#x2019;s weakest in terms of being able to supply the vast demands made on it moment to moment.
