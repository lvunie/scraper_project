## Overview 

Asset localization picks up where translation ends. An organization new to China often needs not just an optimal name translation, but an entire style guide and customized glossary, in order to create a foreign language syntax aligned with its carefully considered branding.

WPIC maintains a network of both certified translators and experienced Mandarin copywriters. They work together with both native English and Mandarin-speaking editors, in a double draft process that ensures on-brand messaging with maximum impact on Chinese viewers.

&#xA0;

Our team is experienced in compiling style guides with all the entries for conventions and tone that will ensure communications as unique as your brand. Specialized glossaries and termbases will clarify commonly misunderstood source terms and provide an ongoing asset to all of your China marketing stakeholders. Automated memory lists will serve to reduce the amount of translation you need to do for future content creation, and allow for quick adjustments to source content.
