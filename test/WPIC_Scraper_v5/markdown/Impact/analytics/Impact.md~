## Impact 

A computer memory manufacturer wanted to phase out its China distributors and tackle China market penetration primarily online. At issue were which of the myriad platforms on which to sell, advertise, or otherwise promote its planned SKUs for the China market. The target set was $10m in revenue for the first year of sales, at a budget of 18% of planned revenue.

Tactics:

1.  Build a custom scraping tool to pull info from selected Chinese search engines, social media platforms, BBS, and focused portals
2.  Program scraper with algorithms to pull keywords, keyphrases, as well as varying ranges of symbols, numbers, and Mandarin characters around them
3.  Build t SQL database that segments data automatically
4.  Build customized dashboard to track and report individual ads, clicks, raw leads, and cost per conversion in each vertical, including Tmall, with traditional Baidu analytics integrated.

Results:

The scraper project yielded actionable evidence on key competitors, consumer profiles, most popular SKUs, consumer concerns relative to those SKUs, and price points. Statistics coupled with manual research revealed that Tmall and an array of focused portals would be the most cost-effective to sell on, relative to return on advertising investment.
