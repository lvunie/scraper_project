## Overview 

Even plain, reliable site metrics can be a tall order in mainland China, where Google has negligible influence. Then consider that huge Chinese companies besides Baidu, China&#x2019;s Google, have their own massive portals, with proprietary traffic, companies such as Sina, Tencent, and Alibaba. The ultra competitive nature of China&#x2019;s Internet landscape means the task of collecting continuous, dependable feedback on your marketing efforts is more complex by an order of magnitude.
