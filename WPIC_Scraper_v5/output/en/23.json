Counter-intuitive, low-trust-creating UI is just as responsible for lost sales. The same holds true online in China, doubly so for western sites, whose payment options and procedures all too often greatly limit the number of Chinese who can transact with them. The surging popularity of mobile payments in China adds another important consideration towards an ideal payment solution., ,Currently, Alipay has over 60% market share for online payments, but other players such as Tencent offer products with competitive benefits, while China’s big banks are rapidly positioning to capture market share, especially in the mobile sector., ,WPIC has vast experience in configuring, then facilitating, both 3rd party platform and China bank accounts, ensuring that you can provide convenient payment solutions with guaranteed compliance., ,Get in touch now to explore China payment gateway options, and to qualify for ten free hours of customized consultation."
