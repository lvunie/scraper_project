## Overview 

There is a reason you&#x2019;ll hear the word &#x201C;integration&#x201D; used all too often in reference to the digital industry. Those who still think of a website as a discrete entity must re-envision their company&#x2019;s online presence as an ecosystem of fluid, interdependent components: applications, widgets, 3rd party software, active databases&#x2026;all necessary to providing the user experience your customers demand.

&#xA0;

Nonetheless, the principle that &#x201C;less is more&#x201D; applies to systems design as much as it does to other design discipline. WPIC therefore proceeds from function to form, designing and implementing systems which impress with simplicity and speed. Your system may be as simple as an app tracking your distributors&#x2019; sales, but generally, the greater your targets for the China market, the more moving parts will be involved.
