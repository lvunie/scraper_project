Fortune 200 company had six operating companies in China, all running severely under-performing PPC campaigns. Part of WPICâ€™s scope of services consisted of designing, implementing, and hosting landing pages for PPC ads, external to the company site.

1.  Wireframe of 50+ landing pages by best practice principles: display product in context, rephrase ad copy, provide call to action and value proposition, and so on
2.  Collaborate with client stakeholders in guidelines for keeping landing pages on-brand, and with client-approved messaging
3.  Collect and localize existing client graphics approved for use
4.  Create new graphics after client approval
5.  Implementation of graphics into landing pages

Results:

Multi-variant testing revealed that original WPIC-designed graphics out-performed those tested against principles, e.g., not depicting a person using the product being sold. The client re-used many of the graphics delivered for different marketing/advertising campaigns.
