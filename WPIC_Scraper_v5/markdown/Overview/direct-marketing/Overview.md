## Overview 

Direct marketing shares several favorable characteristics with PPC &#x2013; it&#x2019;s not sexy, it&#x2019;s not simple, and it requires a lot of testing to get it right. As a result, it presents arbitrage opportunities for organizations that leverage expertise in driving results through the channel. In China, email and SMS databases can be bought or rented for amounts that promise ROI even with the fractional conversions they offer.

&#xA0;

What&#x2019;s more, positioning a western organization effectively through direct marketing in China promises higher conversion rates than domestic messaging generates, given the campaign is well conceived and executed.

&#xA0;
