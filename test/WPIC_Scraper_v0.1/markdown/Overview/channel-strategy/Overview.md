## Overview 

If you are in business today, you are adapting your organization to the wealth of new direct channels opening up, and to the shortened process of indirect channels. It&#x2019;s an ongoing, experimental process that takes on whole new layers of complexity when applied to China. Third party ecommerce platforms, focused industry portals, physical distribution agreements, and in-country sales reps, are some of the major pieces of a puzzle that must be put together as seamlessly as possible to present a unified brand experience.
