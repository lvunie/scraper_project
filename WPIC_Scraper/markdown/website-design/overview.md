## Overview 

Rest assured &#x2013; the cultural pundits are wrong. Principles of good UX are universal. Everyone likes clean, dynamic, image-driven, and intuitive. Everyone appreciates transparency and authenticity from your website.

&#xA0;

So the challenge for your China site lies in adjusting not for multicultural, but rather multi-tech environment adjustments. Designing for different Internet speeds, integrating with different third party APIs &#x2013; a host of complexities stand between the clear messaging of your website and your target Chinese customers.

&#xA0;

WPIC offers a multi-disciplined team, experienced in addressing all China complexities, while still delivering the hallmarks of a superior website &#x2013; clean code, responsive design, full integration, and user-friendly CMS.
