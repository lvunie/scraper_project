## Impact  

A B2B real estate publisher based in England sought to build an engaged community of Chinese real estate agents that it could connect to its existing base of global agents in order to tap the booming segment of Chinese overseas property buyers.

Tactics:

1.  On-brand identity guide for China, including translation of company name, copy guide, and materials design guide.
2.  Compilation of interactive glossary for lexicon of complex real estate, finance, and mortgage terms
3.  Redesign of logo and key media assets

Results:

Key concept and messaging of company, “Reliable, informed overseas investment news” successfully carried over to Chinese audience, with ongoing translation costs greatly reduced by implementation of automatically compiling lexicon.
