Unfortunately, many organizations trust their copy to a translation firm whose main scope of experience is legal, technical, and medical documents. Add to that the fact that written Mandarin is vastly different from written, and the case for a firm with both professional translation and copywriting capabilities becomes apparent., ,WPIC maintains a network of both certified translators and experienced Mandarin copywriters. They work together with both native English and Mandarin-speaking editors, in a double draft process that ensures on-brand messaging with maximum impact on Chinese viewers., ,Our translation approach carries over into multimedia formats such as video subtitling, dubbing, and original copywriting.
