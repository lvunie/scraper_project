## Impact 

A Canadian government organization desiring Chinese leads for investment in key industrial and agricultural sectors. Investmentor numbers for China lagged those for the rest of the markets targeted, and cost per lead was much higher than average.

1.  Creation of bowler with pre-established KPIs and assigned ownership of leads
2.  Research of Chinese Internet for suitable sites, rates, and estimated reach of sites
3.  Establishment of contact with account managers at sites deemed suitable for campaign
4.  Negotiation of rates, associated content marketing added for account spends
5.  Design and implementation of display ad banners and copy
6.  Track metrics daily, full reporting & ad adjustment weekly

Result:  A six month campaign saw conversions per day in China go from .3 to 6 on average, while cost per lead (CPL) went from $172 to $48, making it the lowest CPL for any market save the U.S.A.
