## Overview 

Now that more Chinese use mobile devices to access the Internet than laptops or PCs, the world outside the Web is growing too quickly to ignore the possibilities.&#xA0; While the mobile advertising industry is nascent and fragmented in China, there are nonetheless still incredible opportunities, especially in arbitrage advertising rates, as costs per click are far below those for web-accessed platforms, relative to their traffic volume.

&#xA0;

In fact, navigating China&#x2019;s mobile advertising industry is still murky enough that it is generally the province of app developers looking to monetize. WPIC, however, has carved out a network of reliable partners, who can place advertising in targeted apps across China&#x2019;s vast and fragmented mobile ecosystem. We can outsource everything from design of your ads and landing pages, to account management, to comprehensive reporting via manual report and/or shared dashboard.
