## Overview 

Despite the explosion in app usage, eighty percent of China&#x2019;s Internet traffic still originates from search engines, with Baidu maintaining dominant market share. Appearing on the first page of search engine results, for keywords your target audience is searching for, remains the most efficient form of digital marketing available.

&#xA0;

Baidu has different procedures and standards for providing Chinese visitors with the best content possible. By and large, however, it and other Chinese search engines follow and trail Google best practice. WPIC is well-versed in accommodating the differences of Baidu regulations and ranking algorithms, as well as in leveraging the delta between Google and Chinese search engines.
