## Impact 

A Canadian government organization found itself unable to implement online advertising in China due to ICP registration history conflicts.

Tactics:

Persistent liaising with Ministry of Information leads to acquisition of dedicated MoI representative responsible for advising on next steps. Registration process reveals previous incomplete application for ICP initiated by associated organization. Conflicts resolved via paperwork. Further bureaucratic review results in requests for changes to site, which WPIC implements after advisement with appropriate Canadian government contact.

Results:

ICP number obtained within one month, after government advertising campaign in China had been stalled for more than six months. SEM campaign launched immediately thereafter, returning impressive ROI.
