## Impact 

Global medical supply company with complex hosting schema, unable to host in China. Media-heavy site (17k+ indexed pages) compromised as a result, leading to unacceptably slow load times and lead loss.

Tactics:

1.  Monitor site performance across 500 targeted locations across China
2.  Map data points on network latency and performance degradation for baseline metrics
3.  Comprise inventory of images, documents, CSS files, and script files to be hosted on CDN
4.  Map reference points to CDN from within CMS
5.  Design and implement CDN configuration
6.  Ongoing testing to gauge performance

Results:

Load times originally 11-12 times longer reduced to on par performance with U.S. times.
