## Overview 

The overall goal of winning market share in China often devolves into separate projects of significant scope: infrastructure implementation, technical development, new business systems creation, and other undertakings that require significant planning to minimize risk and assure at least baseline outcomes.

WPIC&#x2019;s experience in designing and executing China operational projects can translate into significant value. We use the Objective Oriented Planning framework, and incorporate aspects of China best practice, developed from our successful track record of assisting global organizations. A WPIC project plan incorporates the following components:

*   Agreed objectives &#x2013; goal categories and project purpose
*   Situation Analysis &#x2013; problems and potentials, the project environment
*   Project Strategy &#x2013; resources, activities, alternatives, risks &amp; assumptions
*   Responsibilities &amp; Roles &#x2013; monitoring, evaluation, progress reporting
*   Project Planning Matrix &#x2013; shared touch point for ongoing synchronization

We realize that our plan&#x2019;s value is not proven until the project is successfully completed, on budget, on target. Which is why our project plan service is not complete until your project is. Stakeholders managing your China project have WPIC as a resource along all phases.
