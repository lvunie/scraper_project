In an environment where government controlled mass communications have marginal brand equity, private Internet portals have become the news source of choice. Companies like Sina and Sohu are trusted sources of timely information for all mainstream categories – think Yahoo meets the New York Times. Even better, these portals and others are thoroughly integrated, enabling endless opportunities for touchpoints., ,This advantage means WPIC can confidently recommend digital PR over its traditional counterpart in China (excluding auto and potato chip manufacturers). The cost per focused eye is invariably lower, and the reach exceeds traditional China PR for virtually any relevant demographic., ,Best of all, the level of platform convergence in China gives targeted viewers a wealth of next steps far beyond email, allowing digital public relations to transcend its role and drive the viewer journey past awareness to next steps., ,WPIC’s combination of in-house content production and media network translate into end-to-end Chinese PR capabilities for western organizations that need comprehensive, strategic messaging across a broad demographic., ,Get in touch to explore how a China digital PR campaign can impact your overall marketing campaign."
