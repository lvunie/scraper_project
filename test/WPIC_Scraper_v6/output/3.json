The Information Age enables consumers to compare products and services quickly and objectively, leaving little need to rely on a brand’s reputation. Therefore, branding is no longer an exercise in telling stories, or “telling” anything else, for that matter. Rather, it is an exercise in showing consumers value by engaging them along every phase of the sales journey., ,The Internet has created both this new model of branding, as well as the means by which to implement it. Digital marketing channels are growing integrated, so that performance marketing, social media, content marketing, and their variations can be rapidly deployed to work together in creating a new, vibrant brand experience for Chinese consumers., ,WPIC has developed a vetted process that gears western brands for quick, sustainable, revenue-generating traction in the China market.
