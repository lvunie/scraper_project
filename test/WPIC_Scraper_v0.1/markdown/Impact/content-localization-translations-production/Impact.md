## Impact 

Client: The world’s largest online cigar vendor sought to establish a Chinese site, had well over 1000 SKUs, employing quite a bit of terminology not yet translated into Chinese. Wanted to communicate varying qualities of a very diverse range of cigars in order to drive sales.

Tactics:

1.  Appoint both native English and native Mandarin-speaking editors to implement double draft process.
2.  Assemble team of three certified translators and two copywriters, reporting to Chinese editor, who reported simultaneously to western editor, who reported to client, and helped Chinese editor elucidate terminology to translators and copywriters.
3.  Contact established with manager of a Beijing cigar club, incented him to read through product descriptions, vetted the translations as “clear and outstanding”.
4.  Implemented translations on new Chinese site, including shopping cart.

Results:

Range of cigar names and brands previously without results on Chinese search engines now returned for many sites, showing translations were adopted as China industry standard. Top results go to Cigar vendor’s site as original source of cigar terminology and information.
