## Impact 

An air filtration systems company discovered its Chinese site was loading extremely slowly, or not at all, resulting in a near halt to online lead nurturing and sales. The site was hosted in Australia, but had not had previous significant site problems.

Tactics:

1.  Perform quick infrastructure survey – no fundamental problems to site performance discovered
2.  Facilitate registration of mainland China domain and ICP
3.  Facilitate and configure China cloud hosting solution (in this case, with Aliyun)

Results:

Site was live again within two weeks, with average page load times under three seconds. Normal online marketing and sales activity resumed, with corollary benefit of marked improvement in keyword rankings on Baidu search engine, due to improved site performance.
