    "Copywriting is as important in engaging a Mandarin-speaking audience as it is an English-speaking one. Unfortunately, many organizations trust their copy to a translation firm whose main scope of experience is legal, technical, and medical documents. Add to that the fact that written Mandarin is vastly different from written, and the case for a firm with both professional translation and copywriting capabilities becomes apparent.",
