## Overview 

Addressing the APAC region as a single market is a high level approach that requires granular strategy. Each major country has its preferred search engines and platforms, with different regulations applying to establishment of a robust digital presence. To add a layer of complexity, APAC&#x2019;s digital landscape is undergoing constant transformation, as ecommerce and mobility transform the consumer base in turn.

&#xA0;&#xA0;

As mainland China constitutes sixty percent of the APAC ecommerce market, WPIC focuses its efforts here, but has run campaigns involving all major APAC countries. Our region-wide network of team members and partners provide reliable data and insight into best online marketing practices.
