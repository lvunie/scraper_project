<span style="font-size: medium;">One-to-three day delivery is not necessarily a critical factor in converting a Chinese online consumer, thank goodness. The multi-week wait that overseas purchases entail is acceptable, as evidenced by the fast growing cross-border sector, worth $33 billion in China in 2013. However, that wait is acceptable if the product in question is not available domestically in China, or if that product available is of questionable authenticity, or if the cross-border option delivers substantial savings.&#xA0;</span>

Now, however, Alibaba has launched ePass, which allows relatively easy integration of Alipay, China&apos;s preferred payment gateway, into a western site, as well as remittance of payments in 14 international currencies.
