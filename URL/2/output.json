                        "Brand equity, as we used to know it, has plummeted in China as much as in the West. The Information Age enables consumers to compare products and services quickly and objectively, leaving little need to rely on a brand’s reputation. Therefore, branding is no longer an exercise in telling stories, or “telling” anything else, for that matter. Rather, it is an exercise in showing consumers value by engaging them along every phase of the sales journey.",

The brand needed to convey luxury, reliability, and expertise. Furthermore, the brand needed to be launched across a broad yet targeted section of the Chinese Internet, in order to gain relatively rapid traction and recognition."
